# Good commit messages

## What you will learn

- Write half-automated abd scalable commit messages

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

We are going to half-automate the git messages with [`git-cz`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

- [ ] Make sure your repo is [commitizen friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly)

There is [tons of adapters](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#adapters) to align your commit strategy with your build process. In this exercice we are going to use `cz-emoji` because it's simple.

- [ ] Install `cz-emoji` with

```language
npm install --save-dev cz-emoji
```

- [ ] Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {

  },
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "cz-emoji"
    },
    "cz-emoji": {
      "skipQuestions": [
        "body",
        "breaking"
      ]
    }
  },
}
```

- [ ] Use `git cz` to commit your work

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] add `cz-conventional-changelog` to automatically generate changelogs with tags
