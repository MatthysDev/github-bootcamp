# Good commit messages

## What you will learn

- Write half-automated abd scalable commit messages

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 2

We are going to half-automate the git messages with [`git-cz`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

- [ ] Make sure your repo is [commitizen friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly)

There is [tons of adapters](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#adapters) to align your commit strategy with your build process. In this exercice we are going to use `cz-emoji` because it's simple.

- [ ] Install `cz-emoji` with

```language
npm install --save-dev cz-emoji
```

- [ ] Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {

  },
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "./node_modules/cz-emoji"
    },
    "cz-emoji": {
      "skipQuestions": [
        "body",
        "breaking"
      ]
    }
  },
}
```

- [ ] Use `git cz` to commit your work

## üëΩ Bonus

We Automatically [create a `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- [ ] Add `auto-changelog` to automatically generate changelogs with tags
- [ ] Add a new script `npm changelog`

```json
// package.json

"scripts": {
  ...
  "changelog": "auto-changelog -p && git add CHANGELOG.md",
}
```

Now we need a way to handle the `git tags`

- [ ] `take bin` to create a new folder
- [ ] `touch release` and copy this

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "Starting the release: what's your version? Example: 1.0.0"

read next_version
echo ''
echo '==============================='
echo "üî≠ Creating tag $next_version  "
echo '==============================='
echo ''
git tag -a $next_version -m "chore: ü§ñ release $next_version"
```

- [ ] Now you can generate a changelog with `npm changelog`
