# Git basic commands

## What you will learn

- Create slides with markdown
- The git basic commands

## 📡 Installation

- You should have sucessfully [completed the setup](../setup/README.md)
- Your GitHub account should be associated with a ssh key, [if not do it now](https://archive.davidl.fr/dev/git.html#associer-son-compte-github)

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [add a star on the repo `github-bootcamp`](https://github.com/flexbox/github-bootcamp) to keep track for later on https://github.com/stars
- check the [`oh-my-zsh` Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.1

- [ ] Configure user settings with

```console
git config --global user.name "Your full name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@provider.com"
```
- [ ] Check your identity

```console
git config -l
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.2

We are goint to create slides for your next talk with [`mdx-deck`](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck).

Create a new folder somewhere (_Example: `./workspace/github-bootcamp/`_) and run theses commands

```console
npm init
npm i -D mdx-deck
touch deck.mdx
```

```mdx
<!-- deck.mdx -->

# GitHub Bootcamp

---

## This is my deck

---

## Happy Hacking

```

```json
// package.json

"scripts": {
  "start": "mdx-deck deck.mdx",
  "build": "mdx-deck build deck.mdx",
  "help": "mdx-deck"
}
```

```console
npm start
```

Congratulations, now you need to initialize your new repo with

```console
git init
```

Now we are going to ignore some files. Run this to create a `.gitignore` file and ignore the `node_modules` foler.

```console
echo 'node_modules' > .gitignore
```

Save your work with

```console
gss
gaa
gcmsg ':new: initial commit'
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.3

All the new slides should be based on the `oh-my-zsh` cheatsheet. And feel free to commit your changes during the process.

✅ `gss`
⌛ `git status -s`  <--- using this is fine but we should learn the fast and shorcut way

- [ ] Create a slide "Create a new repository"
- [ ] Create a slide "Review changes"
- [ ] Create a slide "Commit changes"

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] create a `git today` alias to check what you have accomplished today

This is an example of my configuration

```console
alias.today=log --since=midnight --author='Your full name' --oneline
```
