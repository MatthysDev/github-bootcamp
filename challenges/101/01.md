# Git basic commands

## What you will learn

- Create slides with markdown
- The git basic commands

## 📡 Installation

- You should have sucessfully [completed the setup](../setup/README.md)
- Your GitHub account should be associated with a ssh key, [if not do it now](https://github.com/flexbox/davidl/blob/master/source/dev/git.html.slim)

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [add a star on the repo `github-bootcamp`](https://github.com/flexbox/github-bootcamp) to keep track for later on https://github.com/stars
- check the [`oh-my-zsh` Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.1

- [ ] Configure user settings with

```console
git config --global user.name "Your full name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@provider.com"
```
- [ ] Check your identity

```console
git config -l
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.2

We are goint to create slides for your next talk with [`spectacle`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle).

Create a new folder somewhere (_Example: `./workspace/github-bootcamp/`_) and run theses commands

```console
npx create-spectacle
cd 'name-of-your-folder'
npm install raw-loader --save-dev
npm run build
npm start
```

```mdx
<!-- slides.md -->

# GitHub Bootcamp

## This is my slide

---

## Happy Hacking

```

```json
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --hot --config ./webpack.config.js",
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "build": "webpack --config ./webpack.config.js --mode production"
  },
```

```console
npm start
```

Congratulations, now you need to initialize your new repo with

```console
git init
```

Now we are going to ignore some files. Run this to create a `.gitignore` file and ignore the `node_modules` foler.

```console
echo 'node_modules' > .gitignore
```

Save your work with

```console
gss
gaa
gcmsg ':new: initial commit'
```

## 📡 How to explore aliases?

Aliases are a great way to be super productive. But maybe you are wondering what's under the hood? If you are lost you can explore what's behind with

```console
alias gss
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.3

All the new slides should be based on the `oh-my-zsh` cheatsheet. And feel free to commit your changes during the process.

✅ `gss`
⌛ `git status -s`  <--- using this is fine but we should learn the fast and shorcut way

- [ ] Create a slide "How to initialise a new repository"
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Create a slide "How to review changes"
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Create a slide "How to commit changes"
- [ ] Commit your work

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] create a `git today` alias to check what you have accomplished today

This is an example of my configuration

```console
alias.today=log --since=midnight --author='Your full name' --oneline
```
