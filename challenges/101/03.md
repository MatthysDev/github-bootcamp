# Remote on GitHub

## What you will learn

- Save your work Working with GitHub

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- check [`gh` cli documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- https://www.makeareadme.com/

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.1

- [ ] Create a new repo on [repo.new](https://repo.new)

```console
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.2

By default github propose your to create a remote with `https`.

This is anoying because it will ask your credentials everytime 😦. And there is [some operations you can't do](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/).

We can fix it using `ssh` instead of `https` by changing the `remote` url.


- [ ] Generate your ssh key
```console
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- [ ] Ensure SSH Agent is Running
```console
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
- [ ] Copy Your Public SSH Key
```console
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```
- [ ] Go to [github ssh keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- [ ] Paste your ssh and Add it
- [ ] Test your connection
```console
ssh -T git@github.com
```

- [ ] Change the origin of the remote —if you used `https`
```console
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
```
- [ ] Push you repo to github

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.3

- [ ] Try to use only the cli `gh repo view --web` is nice
- [ ] In your file `webpack.config.js` cahnge the `output` part of your code like this 

```js
output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, '/public'),
    filename: 'app.bundle.js'
  },
```

- [ ] Delete the old `/dist` folder
- [ ] Commit your changes
- [ ] Create a [new project on vercel](https://vercel.com/new) and release on production

Your configuration should look like this (except the `slides` folder)

If everything works fine you should have this screen

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.4

- [ ] Write a nice README, you can [have a nice template on makeareadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Using only the cli create a new branch and open a pull request

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.5

- [ ] Create a slide "Pushing changes to remote"
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Create a slide "Pulling changes from remote"
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Merge your pull request
- [ ] Go to your main branch
- [ ] Pull your changes

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Update your `.gitconfig` to automatically correct your typo errors `help.autocorrect=1`
