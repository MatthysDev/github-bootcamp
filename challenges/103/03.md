# GitHub actions

## What you will learn

- Focus on your code and automate actions

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- You should know [what CI/CD means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)
- You may ask yourself "What is a GitHub action?" [everything is on the `github-actions` documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 1

- [ ] create a new file `.github/workflows/linter.yml`

```yml
name: Linter

# Run this workflow every time a new commit pushed to your repository
on: push

jobs:
  # Set the job key. The key is displayed as the job name
  # when a job name is not provided
  super-lint:
    # Name the Job
    name: Lint code base
    # Set the type of machine to run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks out a copy of your repository on the ubuntu-latest machine
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs the Super-Linter action
      - name: Run Super-Linter
        uses: github/super-linter@v3
        env:
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- [ ] Commit to a new branch
- [ ] Open up a pull request and observe the action working
