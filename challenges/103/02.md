# Advanced branching

## What you will learn

- Working together on the same branch

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2.1

- [ ] Change your push config

```console
git config --global push.default current
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2.2

- [ ] Clone the repo of your right neighbor
- [ ] Ask him to invite you as a collaborator on Settings / Manage acess
- [ ] Ask him to create a new branch `feature/guest-posting`
- [ ] Ask him to create a slide "Working together on the same branch"
- [ ] Work directly on his branch with `git checkout --track origin/feature/guest-posting`
- [ ] Update the slide "Working together on the same branch" with some content
- [ ] Commit your work and push (You can do multiple commits)
- [ ] Ask him merge your work on his repo

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2.3

Now we are going to try to deal with conflicts.

- dev2 create a branch `feature/deal-with-conflicts`
- dev1 should work only on `main`
- dev1 create a slide "How to deal with conflicts"
- dev2 create a slide "How to deal with conflicts"

- dev1 push to `main`
- dev2 `gcm && gup`
- dev2 `gc feature/deal-with-conflicts`

If you followed everything dev2 should have a conflict when using:

```console
git rebase main
```

- [ ] Fix the conflict
- [ ] dev2 save the work with `gaa`
- [ ] continue to rebase the next commit with

```console
git rebase --continue
```

🛰 If you are lost you can cancel your `rebase`

```console
git rebase --abort
```
